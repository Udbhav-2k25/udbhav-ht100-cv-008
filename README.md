FocusFlow ID  
Anti-Spoof Biometric Attendance System

FocusFlow ID is a next-generation biometric attendance system that verifies real human presence using the natural autofocus depth signature (“focus flow”) generated when a 3D face comes into camera focus.  
Photos, videos, screens, masks, or deepfakes cannot mimic this optical behavior, making the system inherently resistant to spoofing.

 🚀 What It Does  
- Captures the camera's autofocus sweep to extract a unique depth-based signature.  
- Verifies both identity and liveness without any active user interaction.  
- Works on any regular camera — no additional hardware required.  
- Immune to photos, video replays, 2D attacks, and most deepfakes.  
- Supports multi-face detection for group attendance.

💡 Why This Matters  
Traditional face attendance systems are vulnerable to:  
- Printed photos  
- Screens  
- Video replays  
- Deepfake attempts  

FocusFlow ID eliminates these weak points using physics-based liveness detection that cannot be counterfeited digitally.

📌 Future Scope  
- Thermal and micro-expression liveness  
- FAISS GPU-based faster identity search  
- Mobile/tablet-optimized version  
- Blockchain-secure attendance logs  
- Multimodal authentication (voice + face + depth)
